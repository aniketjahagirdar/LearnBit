            <p><span class="ms-5 ps-5 fs-6">A </span> developer is like a web building contractor, handling both the
              visible and hidden parts of a
              website or app. Imagine a house: the front door, walls, and paint (visible to users) are the
              front-end,
              while the plumbing, electrical wiring, and foundation (hidden but crucial) are the back-end.
              Full-stack
              developers master both sides, using different tools and languages for each. They can build everything
              from
              user interfaces to databases, making them versatile and valuable assets in any development team.
